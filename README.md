Start with [CRSP_Dividend.ipynb](/CRSP_Dividend.ipynb) to find annual dividend payments exported as [dividend_yearly.csv](/dividend_yearly.csv). You will need to download [crsp_div.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eFfL72kUI5mG3O8grn8RZUms9TUE7O40/view?usp=sharing) to feed into this notebook.

Once you have exported [dividend_yearly.csv](/dividend_yearly.csv)., run [Investment_Strategy_Dividend_Yield.ipynb](/Investment_Strategy_Dividend_Yield.ipynb) to build the portfolios.
